## üìà Key Metrics Analyzed
This analysis focuses on calculating the following critical unit economics metrics:

1. **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** - Cost to acquire a new customer
2. **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)** - Average revenue generated per user
3. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** - Direct costs associated with service delivery
4. **Gross Margin** - Profitability after direct costs
5. **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)** - Total revenue expected from a customer
6. **LTV/CAC Ratio** - Efficiency metric for customer acquisition

| Metric            | Value       |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **CAC**           | $1,213.97   |
| **ARPU**          | $284.36     |
| **COGS**          | $20,264     |
| **Gross Margin**  | 75.6%       |
| **LTV**           | $2,115.65   |
| **LTV/CAC**       | 1.74        |

## üìå Key Findings
### ‚úÖ Positive Indicators

- **Strong Gross Margin (75.6%)** - Indicates efficient cost management
- **Healthy LTV/CAC Ratio (1.74)** - Company earns $1.74 for every $1 spent on acquisition
- **Stable Customer Base** - Average lifespan of 9.8 months

### ‚úàÔ∏è Areas for Improvement

- **Customer Acquisition Cost** - Opportunities to optimize marketing spend
- **Customer Retention** - Potential to extend average lifespan beyond 9.8 months

## üí° Business Recommendations

- **Monitor LTV/CAC monthly** to track acquisition performance
- **Optimize marketing channels** to reduce CAC
- **Implement retention strategies** to increase customer lifespan
- **Explore upselling opportunities** to boost ARPU
- **Maintain operational efficiency** to preserve gross margin
